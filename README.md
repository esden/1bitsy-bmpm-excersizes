This repository contains resources for a self guided workshop teaching concepts
of embedded programming on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

This workshop/class uses simple open source tools and the command line to
achieve full understanding of the platform. The choice not to use IDE is
intentional, helping to understand the full stack needed for embedded
programming.
